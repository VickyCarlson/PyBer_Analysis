# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help the CEO of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, by analyzing rideshare data to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. This will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results of PyBer Analysis

Looking at the summary data from the ridesharing DataFrame below, the most profitable type of city for ridesharing for PyBer is the urban cities ($39,854.38), followed by surburban cities ($19,356.33), and the least profitable area is rural cities $4,327.93). The opposite is true for the profitability for drivers, however, with rural being the most profitable based on the average fare per driver ($55.49). Suburban average fares per driver were $39.50 and urban average fares per driver were $16.57.

The reason that the urban cities are more profitable for PyBer is because there is a greater quantity of rides (1,625 for urban compared to 625 for suburban and 125 for rural cites). The number of drivers for the different types of cities follows the same pattern, with urban cities having the most drivers (2,405), suburban cities with 490 riders and rural cities having only 78 drivers.

The graph of "Total Fare by City Type" below shows similar findings from January through April of 2019. While there were some slight variations in data, overall the three lines followed a similar trajectory for total fares when compared to each other over the four months. Urban cities maintained a much higher total fare count than suburban cities or rural cities. Total fare count for rural cities was the lowest of the three city types.

## Results of PyBer Analysis

Based on these results, the three recommendations for the CEO of PyBer would be as follows:

1. One way to increase revenue would be to increase the number of drivers in both the suburban and rural cities. By increasing the number of drivers in these areas, there could be an increase in the total fares for each city type.
2. A second recommendation might be to reduce the cost of the fares for rural cities. The average cost of fares in rural cities is much higher than in suburban or urban cities. By reducing the fares, it might be more attractive for people in rural areas to use rideshares and there could be an increase in the quantity of rides.
3. The third recommendation might be counterintuitive, but it would be to further study the desirability of using a rideshare program in both the rural and suburban areas. Although recommendations one and two above look logical by only considering the numbers shown in the data, there are other factors that go into why there are fewer drivers and rides in both rural and suburban areas than in urban areas. In looking at hte average fare per driver, the fares are almost double in surburban cities compared to urban and triple when rural cities are compared to urban cities. The reason behind this might be that as people move further away from the center of a city, the population is less concentrated, but the travel area is much greater. Riders in suburban cities must travel further, on average, than urban riders. In addition, many urban dwellers do not own cars and use ride sharing more frequently than those in suburban or rural areas. For people living in rural cities, a car is a necessity as there is not an in-depth transportation infrastructure like there is in urban cities. Since rural riders on average have to go further distances than urban riders, the cost of the fares is higher for them. Ride sharing in rural areas may not be a great market. The same is true to a lesser degree for suburban cities.
